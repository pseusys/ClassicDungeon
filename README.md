# ClassicDungeon

Classic Dungeon is a multiplatform rogue-like game, a successor of Android-only game [Classic Dungeon](https://github.com/pseusys/PXL610) and open source classic game [Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon).

The game engine is written from scratch, using Kotlin multiplatform flexibility and bridges to platform-specific IO and graphic libraries.

Game design is under construction.
